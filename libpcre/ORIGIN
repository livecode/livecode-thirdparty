Files in this folder are based on pcre-8.33 (previously pcre-6.7)

Original source archives are available from <http://www.pcre.org/>

Note that it is important that NO_RECURSE is defined in PCRE's
config.h (via --disable-stack-for-recursion) in order to avoid a
regression of bug 16.

The following configuration options were used to generate config.h:
./configure --enable-utf --enable-unicode-properties --disable-pcre8 \
   --enable-pcre16 --enable-static --disable-shared \
   --disable-stack-for-recursion
